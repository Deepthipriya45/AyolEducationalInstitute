    <div id="bloom">Children are exposed to a more formal environment of classroom where basic skills in English, Hindi, Number work, and Environmental Sciences are introduced. The tutorial system with no Homework policy (Classes - I and II) ensures that the children identify themselves with one teacher who acts as a mentor and care taker and can identify individual strengths and weaknesses of the child. The teaching methodology is made interesting through a wide range of fun and play activities and hands on experiential learning.</div></div>

    <div id='blom'>Upper Primary (IV - V):</div>
    <div id="bloom">At this stage the tutorial system is gradually replaced by subject teachers . Apart from the teaching of two languages and Mathematics ,the Environmental Sciences becomes more pronounced as General Science and Social Sciences. A third language is introduced at class 5 level. The curriculum is an extension and enhancement of the basic skills taught at the lower primary level and prepares children for entry into a more defined syllabus of the middle school.</div>
