 <p>A defining characteristic of the curriculum followed at Vishwa Bharati Public School is the way we focus on integrating our mission and values into every aspect of the school programme. We attempt to combine challenging experiences with academic rigor and creative opportunities keeping in mind the basic mission to educate individuals to take responsibility for shaping a better world.
 </p>
 <p>Studies have shown that maximum brain development of a child happens in its formative years. The Star Kids approach ensures all aspects of your child’s growth is taken care of with warmth and affection. In an increasingly competitive world, it pays to have even a slight advantage. .</p>
    <p>We believe that an ambitious curriculum cannot be confined to the four walls of the class room.Therefore, equal importance is given to both curricular and co- curricular components which are skillfully interwoven and integrated to give each child a rich experience. Activities such as sports, field trips and excursions, community services, life skills , fine arts , environmental sensitivity, love for languages and technology –all are essential part of the curriculum.</p>
